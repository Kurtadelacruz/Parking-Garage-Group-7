# Parking Garage Management System

## Overview
The Parking Garage Management System is a Java-based multithreaded application designed to manage vehicle entry, ticketing, payments, and exit operations across one or more parking garages. The system integrates gate simulation, employee login, client-server socket communication, and GUI-based interaction.

## Features
- Ticket generation at entry kiosks
- Fee calculation based on parking duration
- Manual and automated payment processing
- Entry and exit gate control
- Role-based login for Admin and Parking Attendant
- Multi-garage and multi-level support
- GUI client communicating with server over TCP/IP
- System logging and data persistence using serialization
- JUnit 5 test suite for all core modules

## Technologies Used
- Java 11+
- Java Sockets (TCP/IP)
- Java Serialization
- Swing (GUI)
- JUnit 5

## How to Run

### 1. Initialize Garages (First Time Only)
If you are running the system for the first time and need to set up garages:

- Run `Driver.java`  
  This will create garages, parking levels, and admins, and serialize them.

### 2. Start the Server
Once garage data is available:

- Run `ParkingGarageServer.java`  
  This reads the garage object from file and starts the server on port `12345`.

### 3. Start the Client
In a separate terminal or process:

- Run `Client.java`  
  This connects to the server and presents the GUI or CLI to the user.

## Login Credentials
- Admins are created in `Driver.java` and auto-assigned default usernames and passwords.
- Example:
  - Username: `A1` (Admin ID)
  - Password: `adminpass`

- For Parking Attendants (if implemented similarly):
  - Username: `PA1`
  - Password: `password`

## Testing
JUnit 5 tests are provided in the `testing/` directory.

To run all tests:

- Open `AllTests.java`
- Right-click > Run As > JUnit Test (in Eclipse)

Each test targets a specific module (e.g., `DVDTest`, `DVDCollectionTest`) and validates expected behaviors.

## Notes
- All data is serialized to the `/log` folder.
- Manual ticket creation and payment handling are available to Parking Attendants.
- GUI implementation may vary depending on deployment (Swing, console-based, etc.).
