# Parking Garage Management System

## Overview
The Parking Garage Management System is a Java-based multithreaded application that manages vehicle entry, ticketing, payment processing, and exit operations across multiple parking garages. It supports role-based employee login, GUI interaction via socket communication, and structured reporting features.

## Features
- Entry and exit kiosk simulation
- Ticket generation with time-based fee calculation
- Manual and automated payment handling
- Admin-controlled garage configuration
- Multi-garage and multi-level management
- TCP/IP socket-based client-server communication
- GUI for client operations
- Employee login with credential validation
- JUnit 5 testing suite

## Modules
- `modules/`: Core entities (Ticket, Payment, Gate, ParkingGarage, etc.)
- `adapter/`: System interface for building and retrieving garages
- `driver/`: Initialization and admin testing logic
- `scale/`: Server-side logic including `ParkingGarageServer` and `ClientHandler`
- `personel/`: Employee classes like `Admin` and `ParkingAttendant`
- `util/`: Utilities for logging and file I/O
- `testing/`: JUnit 5 test classes

## Technologies
- Java 11+
- Java Sockets (TCP/IP)
- Java Serialization
- Swing (for GUI)
- JUnit 5

## Getting Started

### 1. Compile the Project
Compile all Java files or build the project in your IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ).

### 2. Run the Server
Make sure the garage object is serialized using `Driver.java` once. Then:

```bash
Run ParkingGarageServer.java
